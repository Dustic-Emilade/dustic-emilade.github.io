      <h2>Important Pricing Information</h2>

      <div class="bundle">
        <p>
          All services are priced <strong>per job</strong>, not per hour.
        </p>

        <p>
          Time estimates are provided for scheduling purposes only.
          Pricing is based on the scope of work discussed and
          <strong>does not change based on time spent</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          We do not charge additional fees if a job takes longer than expected,
          as long as the scope matches what was originally discussed.
        </p>

        <p>
          Additional charges may apply only if hidden or undisclosed work
          is discovered (for example, buried debris or rock piles that were
          not disclosed during the quote).
        </p>

        <p class="note">
          Any changes to scope or pricing will always be discussed
          before additional work is performed.

      <h2>How This Service Works</h2>
      <div class="box">
        <p>
          Cleaning and organizing help is a <strong>collaborative process</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This service is not about someone coming in and taking over.
          It works best when the client and worker actively work together
          to sort, clean, and reset spaces.
        </p>
        <p>
          Progress depends on participation from both sides, with the goal
          of creating systems that are easier to maintain moving forward.
